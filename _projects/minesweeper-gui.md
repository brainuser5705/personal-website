#### **Download**
The program can be run through the <code>JAR</code> file. You can download the JAR file along with the source code and <code>README</code> file containing the instructions on the Github page.

#### **About**
Around the beginning of 2021, I became a bit obsessed with Minesweeper. It started off with the command line version and after learning JavaFX in CS2 class, I decided to turned it into a GUI. It uses the <code>MVC (Model-View-Controller)</code> design. The GUI is a simple program so extra functionalities like chording, timing or any other features commonly found in Minesweeper clones are not implemented.

#### **Additional Information**
- I also made a [command line version](/cmdline-minesweeper/).
- Great thanks to the [RIT CS department](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~csci142/) for teaching this, and Robert Donner and Curtis Johnson (creators of the classic Minesweeper game) for creating such an amazing game!
