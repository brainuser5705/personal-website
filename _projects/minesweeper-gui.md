_**[View the project on Github](https://github.com/brainuser5705/minesweeper-gui)**_

#### **Download**
The program can be run through the JAR file. You can download the JAR file along with the source code and README file on the Github page.

#### **About**
Around the beginning of 2021, I became a bit obsessed with Minesweeper. It started off with the command line version and after learning JavaFX from class, I turned it into a GUI. The GUI is a simple program so extra functionalities like chording, timing or any other features commonly found in Minesweeper clones are not implemented.

#### **Additional Information**
- I have also made a [command line version](/cmdline-minesweeper/).

*Great thanks to the RIT CS department for teaching this, and Robert Donner and Curtis Johnson (creators of the classic Minesweeper game) for creating such an amazing game!*
