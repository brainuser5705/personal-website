# WORK IN PROGRESS!

Check out the [Notion notebook](https://petalite-subway-eb3.notion.site/RIT-Dining-API-18031e24752c4db38dc15d894fd4b3f1) for progress!

*Here's what I'm thinking:*
- A web server that webscrapes the RIT Dining website for the daily specials menu (like [Tiger Bot](/tiger-bot)) and puts it in a database interfaced with an API
- The API can then be used to make a "food diary" app where students can log what food they ate in a day, and get weekly reports on their eating habits, etc.
