# Potential Projects


Here is a list of ideas for projects that I am planning to do or thinking about:

<br>

-  **Link Hub**
    - My bookmark bar is always full: links to frequented sites, articles to read, websites to check out, etc. And the funny thing is that I sometimes forget why I even bookmarked a link. And if anyone has used the bookmark manager with Firefox, they would know how it can get a little bit frustrating trying to organize it.
    - So the idea is to have a desktop tool that can be used to store links in a database. The links can be inserted with other data like a name, date, and tags. The database can be local or hosted in the cloud, and it can be accompanied with a web application where users can share their links, etc.

- **RIT Dining API**
    - A web server that webscrapes the RIT Dining website for the daily specials menu (like [Tiger Bot](/tiger-bot)) and puts it in a database interfaced with an API
    - The API can then be used to make a "food diary" app where students can log what food they ate in a day, and get weekly reports on their eating habits, etc.
