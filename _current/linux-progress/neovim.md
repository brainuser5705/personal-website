# Why Neovim?

I don't really have good reason for wanting to use Neovim besides:
* I already know basic Vim key bindings
* I feel like a hacker when I code in it 
* It's extensible with plugins, meaning I can get into plugin development
* A lot of hobbyists that I have seen on YouTube use neovim and it looks cool

# Why not other open-source text editors or development environments?

I actually do want to try out different editing softwares in the future, especially Emacs, to see what they're all about. But it'll be hard pressed to explore at the same time I'm trying to become proficient at them so that's why I am sticking with Neovim for the time being.
