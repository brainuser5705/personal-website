## Features
- "touch sensors" with piezo transducers
- LCD

## Development Notes
- [Circuit diagram (excluding LCD)](https://www.digikey.com/en/schemeit/project/simon-says-51d0543eb37b4b4bafd7744fbdb79bc4)
- Used [`LiquidCrystalIO` library](https://github.com/davetcc/LiquidCrystalIO) by Adafruit
```c
#include <LiquidCrystalIO.h>
#include <IoAbstractionWire.h>
#include <Wire.h>
```

## Resources/Tutorials Used
- [How to use a piezo transducer as a touch sensor](https://docs.arduino.cc/built-in-examples/sensors/Knock/)

Clockwise: 1) Funnel design for box, 2) Pockets for trapped kibble leading to jam when closing, 3) Internal circutry and wiring

## [Github](https://github.com/brainuser5705/automatic-dog-feeder)

## Features
- 3 triggers: Bluetooth, physical button, scheduled (in code)

## Development Notes
- Arduino board: [Nano 33 IOT](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/nano-33-iot/#tech-specs)
    - Since I used a board with the header pins setup for breadboard use, using the [pinout diagram](https://docs.arduino.cc/resources/pinouts/ABX00027-full-pinout.pdf) was helpful to see where I needed to put the connections
- Code for the **Bluetooth feature** sampled from the [offical Arduino tutorial](https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/nano-33-iot/bluetooth/#bluetooth-low-energy-and-bluetooth)
    - Service is the Arduino with the servo activation boolean (`0` for closed, anything else for open) as the characteristic
- Code for **automatic time activation feature** sampled from [offical Arduino tutorial](https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/nano-33-iot/iot-cloud/#goals) about the internal RTC of the board
    - [Thread](https://forum.arduino.cc/t/wanting-to-perform-actions-during-certain-times-of-day-how-does-one-code-this/452668/5?u=codeuser5705) that led me to the idea of using RTC
    - To keep the RTC in sync with real-world time, the code connected via WiFi to an NTP server and updates the RTC - idea taken from this [thread](https://forum.arduino.cc/t/arduino-rtc-does-not-stay-in-sync-despite-use-of-arduinocloud-getlocaltime/1204968/6?u=codeuser5705), [library with examples](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/NTPClient), [tutorial article for Nano 33 IOT](https://nerdhut.de/2021/12/15/arduino-esp32-esp8266-ntp/)
        - It uses the [`RTCZero` library](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/rtczero/)'s `set*` methods
- [Connecting servo motors](https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/electronics/servo-motors/)
    - Orange signal pin must wired to a *PWM* pin
    - Used the `Sweep` example with `for` loops for the open/close motion
