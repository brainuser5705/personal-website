- [Monty Hall Problem](https://github.com/brainuser5705/monty-hall-problem)
    - Java implementation of the classic Monty Hall problem
    - the best answer: say yes
- [Sorting Algorithm Visualizer](/sorting-visuals)
    - made with `ProcessingJS` library
    - implemented with an interface, so all I had to do was code up the specific algorithm
    - fuelled my dislike for Javascript
- [Sudoku solver](https://github.com/brainuser5705/sudoku-solver)
    - learned about backtracking in CS2 and decided to try to solve sudoku puzzles with it
    - also watched Computerphile's Sudoku solver video
- [Pygame Pong](https://github.com/brainuser5705/py-game-pong)
    - recreation of classic Pong game
    - went through the RealPython tutorial to introduce my brother to coding and decided to try to implement Pong myself
- [Servings Converter](/servings-converter)
    - very crude Javascript
    - literally just modifying DOM elements
