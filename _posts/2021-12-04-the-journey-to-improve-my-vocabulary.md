Like the title says, I want to improve my vocabulary. I want to:
- use more advanced, expressive words,
- be more articulate in explaining,
- and most importantly, be able to read books without stopping every two sentences to look up a word

Also like the title says, this entire process is a journey. In fact, a lifestyle. Given that there are more than a 170,000 words in the English language (I reckon I know 5% of it), it’s not going to be a one-time ordeal. No, I have to dedicate myself to this (not entirely, just make a daily habit). To keep it simplistic for my tiny, feeble brain, I’m not going to go all out and study a hundred words a day. Here is what I will do, basically for the rest of my life I guess:
1. 10 new words a day (again, not going overboard)
2. Spaced repetition
I have been aware of this study strategy for a good while now, but never got down to a solid habit of using it. Now is the time.
3. Application
Using it in daily life (use the current words I am learning), write a very short story using the words (great to boost my creativity), have conversations with myself (sad)

This should be fun. I might update this post later in the future just to look back.
