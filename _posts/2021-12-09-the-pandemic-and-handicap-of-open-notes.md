Just me rambling about my test taking experience in college so far and taking exams

----

I started college in 2020, aka the year of COVID. And along with that, came a lot of "handicaps" (that's the term I am using) intended to relieve the additional stress and anxiety that the pandemic brought along. These handicaps include, but not limited to:
- pass/fail option for final grades
- leniant grading
- extended drop/withdrawal dates
- and open notes

One particular handicap that I want to talk about is *open notes*. For those you who don't know, open notes is when you are allowed to use actual notes/material during the exam, whether to reference or maybe even plainly copying the answers. Typically for the student, that means there is no need to rote memorize facts, formulas, or methods because all of that can be reference from the notes. And I think that open note model is a lot more similar to the traditional closed note way because in real life, especially in the age of the internet, things can be easily searched up and *recalled*.    
<br>
But notice I use the word *recalled*. The basic premise of *recalling* something, versus *relearning* something for example, is that you already have prior knowledge or experience with the topic and just need a little information to spark up your memory. Relearning on the other hand meant that you completely forgot the topic and need to start from stratch (this is more of a strict definition, but expresses the contrast between recalling and relearning).    
<br>
So what happens when open notes is an available option, is that the student doesn't put as much effort in actually learning (and that requires memorization) instead heavily relying on the notes. Sure they might pick up a few things or the general concept, but there's always the possibility that they don't.   
<br>
Don't get me wrong, I have used open notes myself. In fact, I think it would be foolish for a student to not take advantage of that considering you literally have the course material right there for you to use. But I always felt a bit of guilt after using it. The aid of open notes stripped away the sense of accomplishment, in that I couldn't have finish the test without it. That loss of merit then leads to the belief (or anxiety) that I actually don't understand the material. And all of those cons of open notes I mentioned in the last paragraph is moreso what I have done. I don't remember the time where I actually sat down to review material because I knew that I can just reference it in times that I need to.  
<br>
Obviously I don't think everyone would think like this. Maybe open notes is more suited to a realistic learning pedaology, but I think the closed notes also drives the student to learn more (even if that means memorizing) about the subject, which in the long run is better.
