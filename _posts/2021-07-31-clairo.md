*(This is a repost)*. I wrote this back in the summer of 2021 when I literally had nothing going on in my life. I'm cringing at myself too. Don't judge me please (╥︣﹏᷅╥).

**Hi and welcome to a blog post that nobody asked for (or possibly even read lol).**  
*I'm supposed to be making posts about my projects, but I'm procrastinating on that. Also as I am writing this, I am having a quarter-life crisis (if that even is a thing), so a girl gotta do what she gotta do to feel better (lol).* 
  
If you read my status updates *(idk why would you tho)*, you might have caught on that I am a Clairo fan. Which is why this blog post is dedicated to her! Or more specifically, how I came to like her. You might want to know that unless you're a Clairo fan, you probably won't find this interesting. **Anyways...**

### How I discovered Clairo

The first song I ever heard from her unknowingly was [Sofia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9l8zCOwEII). I heard it from some TikTok compilation video and somehow I recognized it when the song came up on autoplay *(I think I was listening to Conan Gray before it popped up)*. At that time, I wasn't "into the song" per say; it was more recognition that caught my attention. One thing led to another during the following days, that somehow turned me into a Clairo *(~cough~)* simp *(I don't know if I should be proliferating this, but there's actually a [subreddit for Clairo simps](https://www.reddit.com/r/simpsforclairo/))*.  
<br>
One day I was lying in bed, playing some Mastermine *(self plug: check out my Minesweeper project)*, and had her Spotify playlist in the background. And from that, I found the first songs that were immediate hits for me:
- [Drown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1VyGyWpQpU) - Cuco X Clairo
- [4EVER](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlGUom_AV4o)
- [B.O.M.D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC3BXUn-EPM)
- etc.

These songs were mostly from her *diary 001* era *(not sure if era is the right word, I'm using kpop parlance here)*. I'm not a musically oriented person, more so just listening to what sounds good to me which generally leans more towards mainstream pop. As I kept listening though, I got into her *Immunity* songs other than *Sofia*, substainly different from my typical music genres. My top favorites without listing all the songs:
- [Impossible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jmyew3UsHg)
- [Softly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQdgdWayPhQ)
- [Closer To You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zFJZtwY4tM)
- [North](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Tzl8vISjQ)

### Pretty Girl

For those of you who are non-Clairo fans that are actually reading this, firstly thank you very much. Secondly, you might want to know that Clairo's breakout song was *[Pretty Girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mngtcfcaVrI)* back in 2017. At first I wasn't so much into the song, but someday it all changed. I cannot recall the amount of times I have mentioned *Pretty Girl* *(I guess I have that annoying fangirl vibe)*.  The killing part *(kpop term here)* is "how you felt in my hands". You probably won't understand my explanation, especially since I'm not fond of musical terminology, but it's where you expect it to a higher key *(?)* but it actually stays the same. I don't if that even made sense, it's just **SO GOOD**. And the bedroom pop aesthetic of the music video makes it the song so much more enjoyable. I can't really describe how I feel when I listen to this song, but from a very minor reflection, I supposed it has something to do with my experience with femininity and being a teenage girl *(which is part of what Clairo's meaning behind the song was)*. I can't explain what changed for me to start liking the song **a lot**, but I'm happy for it. 

### Behind the Music

When I listen to music, I would say it is the beat/instrumental that gets my attention first. Once I establish my liking for a song, then I would go on to read the lyrics. Most of the time, the lyrics are extremely cryptic (or sometimes, I find shallow) and I don't think much of it.  
<br>
Reading Clairo's interviews about *Immunity* showed me that music can be personal. I guess all that mainstream music I was into didn't convey that to me, but after reading the about experiences she dealt with and it is captured in the lyrics of her songs, was an eye-opening experience. I highly recommend whoever likes Clairo or even wants to get to know more about her read [her Papermag interview](https://www.papermag.com/clairo-immunity-2639447111.html?rebelltitem=50#rebelltitem50).
<br>
I realize that the artists that are making these songs are making it for a reason other than for fame or money. I know it sounds stupid, but I realize that songs have a purpose not just for the listeners but for the artist too.

### Live stages
In my kpop phase, I was into watching live stages and fancams. This very much continue with my Clairo "phase". There are plenty of recordings of her performances out there. Her voice is still nice even in a crowded stage room with phone recording quality.

### Branching out
Since becoming a Clairo fan, I have drawn closer to more indie-type music: bedroom pop, city pop, still in the pop genere. 

### Other Songs Worth Mentioning
Clairo has done a few collaborations and like her own songs, they are bops:
- [Racecar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMMshdy-0gw) - Deaton Chris Anthony ft. Clairo, Coco & Clair Clair
- [Throwaway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n256GrUVie0) -  SG Lewis X Clairo
- [Better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqxH3jThqq4) - SG Lewis X Clairo
- [Heaven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRVDXGk2yrc) - Clairo X Skate Kitchen

There are also remixes of Pretty Girl, here are my favorites:
- [vaselin remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DTcYn2fBcc)
- [QB9 remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgkOzXrfFl0&list=LL&index=8)

### New Album: Sling
As of writing, it has been 2 weeks since she released her sophmore album Sling. As much as I like her previous tracks, this album is not hitting it for me. I would say it's mainly the type of music that is straying it away from me. I had read a few interviews prior to listening and I know how this album is about her growth and the epiphanies she had during quaratine, but I can't find myself relating to them or even understanding where to even emphatize with the feeling she is describing. As you might have read from one of my status updates, I think I just need to gain more life experience and maturity. Maybe then I will get the meaning of her songs and connect with the album. With that being said, [Amoeba](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR8ooa3G_5M) is an amazing track.

*Thank you Clairo for making great music and staying true to yourself <3*
