- My bookmark bar is always full: links to frequented sites, articles to read, websites to check out, etc. And the funny thing is that I sometimes forget why I even bookmarked a link. And if anyone has used the bookmark manager with Firefox, they would know how it can get a little bit frustrating trying to organize it.
- So the idea is to have a desktop tool that can be used to store links in a database. The links can be inserted with other data like a name, date, and tags. The database can be local or hosted in the cloud, and it can be accompanied with a web application where users can share their links, etc.
- Maybe I can take some inspiration from Github?
