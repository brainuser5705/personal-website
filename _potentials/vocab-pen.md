The basic premise is that as you are reading a tough book with a bunch of vocabulary that you don't know (yet), instead of having to switch back and forth between your book and your dictionary, you can make the reading experience more seamless by having a pen that defines the word for you. There already are pens in the market with the same functionality that I can buy, but that's no fun (plus it's 300 bucks...). So why not make it myself. Plus I can learn so much in the process: about computer vision, electronics, mobile app development. I'm excited, but realistically, it's going to require a lot of brain racking. Next semester I am taking a course in Maker culture and will be learning about topics within the realm of what this project needs. I'm excited to take the course (and put effort into it) so I can make this idea a reality. It'll be fun ðŸ™‚
